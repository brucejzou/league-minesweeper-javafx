## Reflection
This was a small side project built in order to learn how to implement graphical interfaces in Java. The goal of the project was to build upon my Java knowledge to implement a clone of a game using a graphics library, JavaFX.

One of the main challenges I ran into was JavaFx itself. I had a clear understanding of how the game logic behind Minesweeper needed to be implemented; however, I had no idea how to transfer that game logic into graphical JavaFX objects. I had to spend several days researching and writing short test code snippets to learn JavaFX.

The technologies implemented in this project are Java and JavaFX. The big choice going into this project was which GUI library to use, Swing or JavaFX. At the time, Swing was better documented and more popular, but I decided on JavaFX simply because it was a newer library and provided a bigger challenge due to having less documentation and guides.
